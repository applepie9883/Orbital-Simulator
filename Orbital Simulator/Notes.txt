Port this to my ECS Library, and remove all references to the old SpriteLibrary.

Figure out threading with the ECS Library

Just call SystemsManager.Update(Entity list) on multiple different threads at once

Profiling: With entity library, draw takes about 10 ms, update takes about 15 ms, this is with 20000 orbiters and all 3 systems active
Removing the velocity system and putting the code for that in the orbiter system moves the update time down to 10 ms
checking for the correct components takes 70 - 80% as much time as updating??? component checks are taking about 40 - 45% of update time.
